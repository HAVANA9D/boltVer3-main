      "question": "In the Working Stress Method, what is the primary purpose of the modular ratio, 'm'?",
      "userAnswer": "To account for the difference in the modulus of elasticity between steel and concrete.",

      "question": "How does the Working Stress Method account for different types of loads like Dead Load (DL) and Live Load (LL)?",
